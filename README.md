HTML Light Demo renders a real HTML interface inside a Three.js scene with
[`three-html-render`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-html-render), then
illuminates it with a physics-driven hanging spotlight. Pull the lamp, reshape
the beam, and change its color or brightness—the HTML surface reacts in real
time.

## Highlights

- Real HTML rendered into WebGL through HTML-in-Canvas
- Physically simulated pendulum motion with a constrained Verlet solver
- Live spotlight angle, brightness, color, and power controls
- Mouse-driven aiming, pulling, release momentum, and reset interactions
- Idle-aware rendering that sleeps when the scene is stable

## Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Left mouse | Pull and aim the lamp |
| Release | Let the lamp swing freely |
| Right-drag | Adjust the beam angle |
| Right-click | Cycle the light color |
| Double-click | Reset the lamp |
